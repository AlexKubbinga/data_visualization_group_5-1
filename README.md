Add the data sources and question/issue you want to address 

Environmental, Social and Governance data is becoming more popular and important in our society today. For this reason we wanted to investigate how our own countries and how the world is performing in different ESG criterion. In addition, we also wanted to investigate how different ESG metrics interact with each other. We wanted to tell a story that highlights the differences between our countries and then investigate the interesting trends and relationships we find in the ESG metrics.


**Questions:**
1. How are our countries performing in different ESG metrics?
2. How are different ESG metrics related?

**Summary**
Our story starts by examining GDP per capita in all countries to see the differences in economic development. After seeing an overview of the world, we dig deeper into our own countries GDP per capita and how that has evolved over time.


## ESG overview

Environmental data provides a picture of a country's response to climate change and other natural hazards and includes variables such as Co2 emmissions per capita, Renewable electricity output percentage and GHG emission breakdowns. 

Social data shows how a country is meeting the needs of its population and how it is performing in addressing various social issues. It includes variables such as school enrollment, gender parity in the labor force and unemployment percentage.

Governance data shows how well a country is positioned to ensure long term stability and future growth. It includes variables such as political stability, government effectiveness and regulatory quality.
