# ESG Data Analysis and Visualization

## Backgroud

*Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) Data*


*Environment:*

- This category encompasses key themes, which provide a picture of the sustainability of a country’s economic performance given its natural resource endowment, management and supplementation and its risk or resilience to climate change and other natural hazards. This category pays particular attention to the internalization of environmental externalities created by economic activity. This category also accounts for sustainable energy access and food security, crucial factors for stable long-term economic growth.

*Social:*

- This category encompasses key themes, which provide a picture of the sustainability of a country’s economic performance given its efficacy meeting the basic needs of its population and reducing poverty, management of social and equity issues and investment in human capital and productivity. This category also includes demographic criteria, pertinent to stable long-term economic growth.

*Governance:*

- This category encompasses key themes, which provide a picture of the sustainability of a country’s economic performance given its institutional capacity to support long-term stability, growth and poverty reduction. This category also accounts for the strength of a country’s political, financial and legal systems and capacity to address environmental and social risks.
